# Data Structures Final Project

The final project for my Whitworth Data Structures course was a simulation.  The project entailed simulating a hospital emergency room in a fictional town.  The town has a population of 2000 people whose names are provided from an external file to be read in using file I/O.  Every person in the town is equally healthy and equally likely to need hospital ER care.  When a town person arrives at the ER, they are triaged according to the severity of their illness with more severe illnesses receiving more urgent care (illnesses are categorized from 1-20 with higher ratings correlating to more severe illnesses).  The ER has two categories of caregivers: doctors and nurses.  Doctors can serve any patient and nurses can only serve patients with an illness rating below 11.  The ER keeps records of all patient visits.  The simulation records a week of the ER on a minute-by-minute basis.  The simulation begins by prompting the user to determine key ER factors including the number of nurses in the ER, the number of doctors in the ER, and the average hourly patient arrival rate (up to 60 patients an hour).  The conclusion of the simulation includes a calculation of the average patient visit time as well as a menu allowing the user to view a list of all patients that were treated during the simulation as well as the option to retrieve patient records by name.
